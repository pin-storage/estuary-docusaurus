# Listing your files

After you have [uploaded a file](/Learn/Quickstart/Upload%20Your%20First%20File). You will probably want to list all of your files. To do so you can use the code explorer to the right, just follow these steps:

1. Click Authorize to the right and enter in your HTTP Authentication header. Remember to add the Bearer prefix so the field looks something like this:

   > `Bearer ESTxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxARY`

2. Click the Execute button and your browser will send the API Request!

Once you do so, here is an example of the output:

```
 "42": {
  "id": 36534620,
  "updatedAt": "2022-09-06T22:21:08.039349Z",
  "cid": "bafybeicgpn...uo4xloxypuwm",
  "name": "nature-6.mp4",
  "userId": 243,
  "description": "",
  "size": 83073242,
  "type": 0,
  "active": true,
  "offloaded": false,
  "replication": 6,
  "aggregatedIn": 0,
  "aggregate": false,
  "pinning": false,
  "pinMeta": "",
  "replace": false,
  "origins": "",
  "failed": false,
  "location": "SHUTTLE1f8fbb04-44c2-41a2-a8ac-d3057589dd93HANDLE",
  "dagSplit": false,
  "splitFrom": 0
 },
```

You can use the CID to retrieve the file immediately by using an IPFS Gateway. Here is an example:

> [https://api.pin.storage/gw/ipfs/bafybeicgpn...xypuwm](https://api.pin.storage/gw/ipfs/bafybeicgpnok4bl2rkf4ceojlb376henq6f6ufwqqvyyzmuo4xloxypuwm)

The general format for accessing your content by CID is as follows: **https://api.pin.storage/gw/ipfs/YOUR_DESIRED_CID**

### You are done

You have successfuly put data on the Filecoin Network and you can get a list of the data that will be replicated across Filecoin miners. Check out the rest of our API documentation to learn what else you can do with your API key.
