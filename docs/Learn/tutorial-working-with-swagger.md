## Developer Notes

- If you're a developer looking to just grab the json or yaml files to generate your client code and server stubs, download them [here (yaml)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/application-research/estuary/master/docs/swagger.yaml) and [here (json)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/application-research/estuary/master/docs/swagger.json)
- You can also import the json file on Postman - an API platform for building and using APIs. To learn more about Postman, click [here](https://www.postman.com/)
