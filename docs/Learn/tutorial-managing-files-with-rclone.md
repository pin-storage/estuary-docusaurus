# Managing files with Rclone

### What is rclone?

Rclone _("rsync for cloud storage")_ is a **command-line program** to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers. According to the official [rclone website](https://rclone.org/), there are over 40 cloud storage providers that support rclone. Pin.Storage's rclone support gives developers and users the ability to easily manage their data in either centralized or decentralized manner among various storage providers.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of using rclone to manage your files across several storage options, including local storage, Pin.Storage and Google Drive. We will cover the following：

- Run a Pin.Storage local node
- Install and setup rclone
- Manage files between local computer and Pin.Storage
- Manage files between Google Drive and Pin.Storage

**Prerequisites**:

- go (1.15 or higher)
- hwloc
- opencl
- git

### Step 1: Run Pin.Storage local node

For this tutorial, we will run an Pin.Storage local node to store files to IPFS and Filecoin network. If you do not wish to run your own node, you can also use the Pin.Storage public endpoint **https://api.pin.storage**; you'll need to [request an Pin.Storage invite and get an API token](https://docs.pin.storage/tutorial-get-an-api-key).

For more detailed instructions on running a local Pin.Storage node, see [Getting Started Developing With Pin.Storage](https://github.com/application-research/estuary/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).

- **Download Pin.Storage and build it locally**

```
git clone https://github.com/application-research/estuary.git
cd estuary
make clean all
```

If the build is successful, you can move on to the next step.

- **Start Pin.Storage node**

This step will generate an authorization token for you. It is very important to save this auth token; you will need it to access your files via your Pin.Storage local node.

```shell
./estuary setup
<auth token> #Record this token since you will need it later

./estuary --datadir=/path/to/storage --logging
Wallet address is:  <your_estuary_address_printed_here>

```

You can use the following command to check if Pin.Storage node started successfully:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3004/public/stats

#If estuary node is running, you should see the following data.
{"totalStorage":0,"totalFiles":0,"dealsOnChain":0}
```

### Step 2: Build and configure rclone

**NOTE**: You will need to build and install rclone from the `application-research` fork, rather than rclone's main install processes.

- **Install rclone from source.**

```shell
#Download source and switch to estuary branch.
git clone https://github.com/application-research/rclone.git
cd rclone && git checkout estuary
go build

#Check if rclone is correctly installed
./rclone version
rclone v1.58.0-DEV
- os/version: darwin 12.2.1 (64 bit)
...
```

In this tutorial, we will use some of the rclone commands. Let's get familiar with them first:

- **rclone mkdir remote:path** - make the path if it doesn't already exist
- **rclone lsd remote:path** - list all the directories in remote:path
- **rclone ls remote:path** - list all the objects in the path/directory
- **rclone copy source:path dest:path** - copy files from source to dest
- **rclone sync source:path dest:path** - sync files from source to dest to ensure source and dest are identical

To learn more about rclone commands, see [Rclone Commands Instruction](https://rclone.org/commands/) or use rclone's help menu:

```
./rclone help
```

- **Configure rclone for Pin.Storage access**

In order to let rclone on your local machine access remote storage providers like Pin.Storage and Google Drive, you will need to first configure rclone allow access from the command-line.

In the terminal, run the following command to begin the interactive setup process:

```shell
./rclone config

#This will guide you through an interactive setup process
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> estuaryLocal #Name of remote access
Storage> estuary #Type estuary or use the number from the list.
Pin.Storage API token:
token> <Auth Token generated in the first step>
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (https://api.pin.storage).
url> http://localhost:3004
```

After you finish, you can verify by checking the rclone configuration.

```shell
./rclone config
Current remotes:
Name                 Type
====                 ====
estuaryLocal         estuary
```

### Step 3: Sync files between Pin.Storage and local storage

Once you finish configuring rclone to allow Pin.Storage access, let's try to managing your files between Pin.Storage and local storage. Note that Pin.Storage uses [collections](https://docs.pin.storage/tutorial-working-with-collections) to organize sets of files and folders.

There are various ways to move your files from local storage to Pin.Storage.

- Copy or move files one by one
- Sync the whole folder from local storage to Pin.Storage
- Bi-sync folder between local storage and Pin.Storage

Next, we will explore a few of these methods.

- **Create a new folder which will be treated as collection in Pin.Storage**

```shell
./rclone mkdir estuaryLocal:testLocal -v

#List the directories under estuaryLocal
./rclone lsd estuaryLocal:
 -1 2022-02-25 17:04:43        -1 testLocal
```

- **Copy one file to Pin.Storage**

```shell
./rclone copy /path-to-your-file/estuary-file2.txt estuaryLocal:testLocal

#Check that the file is copied to Pin.Storage
./rclone ls estuaryLocal:testLocal
     1682 estuary-file2.txt
```

- **Sync a local folder to Pin.Storage**

```shell
./rclone sync /path-to-your-folder/ estuary:/longfei

#List all the files in your remote Pin.Storage directory
./rclone ls estuaryLocal:testLocal
     1682 estuary-file2.txt
     1674 test1.txt
     1674 test2.txt
     1674 test3.txt
```

### Step 4: Sync files between Pin.Storage and Google Drive

In this step, we will demonstrate how to sync files between Pin.Storage and Google Drive. Note that rclone supports over [40 different storage providers](https://rclone.org/#providers), so you can use the same steps to sync between Pin.Storage and other storage providers of your choice.

- **Configure rclone for Google Drive**

Moving files between Pin.Storage and Google Drive is as simple as moving files from local to Pin.Storage. But first, you will need to configure rclone to access your Google Drive. You can configure Google Drive following this [tutorial](https://rclone.org/drive/).

Once you finish configuring Google Drive, you will be able to see it in the list of remotes.

```
./rclone config
Current remotes:
Name                 Type
====                 ====
estuaryLocal         estuary
ggDrive              drive
```

Now you will be able to check folders and files in your Google Drive directly using rclone.

```shell
#This command will list all the folders
./rclone lsd ggDrive:
   -1 2022-02-25 11:30:51        -1 Filecoin-Slides
   -1 2022-02-25 11:31:01        -1 Filecoin-Workshops
   -1 2022-02-25 11:36:13        -1 estuaryTest

#This command will list all the files in a folder
./rclone ls ggDrive:estuaryTest
   158798 Pin.Storage-addContent.png
   138349 social-profile.jpeg
      175 rclone-lf.txt
```

- **Create an Pin.Storage collection for your Google Drive files**

Run the following command to create a directory in your Pin.Storage node, which will be created as a collection in Pin.Storage.

```shell
./rclone mkdir estuaryLocal:ggDrive

#List all the folders(collections) in estuaryLocal
./rclone lsd estuaryLocal:
  -1 2022-02-28 10:44:51        -1 ggDrive
  -1 2022-02-28 09:41:08        -1 testLocal
```

- **Sync a folder from Google Drive to Pin.Storage**

In this step, we will sync an entire folder (and its contents) from Google Drive to Pin.Storage. This will copy all the files to your Pin.Storage collection. In this example, our folder is named _ggDrive:/estuaryTest_.

```shell
./rclone sync ggDrive:estuaryTest estuaryLocal:ggDrive -v
Transferred:   	  290.354 KiB / 290.354 KiB, 100%, 92.451 KiB/s, ETA 0s
Transferred:            2 / 2, 100%
Elapsed time:         5.1s

#Verify that there are 2 files moved to Pin.Storage
./rclone ls estuaryLocal:ggDrive
   158798 Pin.Storage-addContent.png
      175 rclone-lf.txt
```

- **Move single file**

You can also just copy a single file from Google Drive to Pin.Storage with the copy command.

```shell
./rclone copy ggDrive:Filecoin-Workshops/Build-on-Filecoin.pptx estuaryLocal:ggDrive

#Verify that Build-on-Filecoin.pptx is moved successfully
./rclone ls estuaryLocal:ggDrive
 13575031 Build-on-Filecoin.pptx
   158798 Pin.Storage-addContent.png
      175 rclone-lf.txt
```

### Step 5: Verify your stored files

In addition to checking the list of files in your Pin.Storage node using rclone commands, you can also verify whether or not those files are actually moved to Pin.Storage by directly querying via the Pin.Storage API. First, let's check if the _ggDrive_ collection is created in Pin.Storage.

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3004/collections/list -H "Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_ME_WITH_API_KEY" -H "Accept: application/json" -s | jq .

#Two collections were added to Pin.Storage from previous steps
[
  {"createdAt": "2022-02-28T09:41:08.015981+08:00",
    "uuid": "uuid-for-testLocal",
    "name": "testLocal",
    "description": "",
    "userId": 1  },
  {"createdAt": "2022-02-28T10:44:51.111857+08:00",
    "uuid": "uuid-for-ggDrive",
    "name": "ggDrive",
    "description": "",
    "userId": 1 }
]
```

This output shows that the _ggDrive_ collection was created successfully, and is being listed with its details. You can use a collection's _uuid_ to query files within that collection.

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3004/collections/content/uuid-for-ggDrive -H "Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_ME_WITH_API_KEY" -H "Accept: application/json" -s | jq .

[
  {
    "id": 21,
    "updatedAt": "2022-02-28T10:51:19.29752+08:00",
    "cid": "bafkreiazxt6iegs6nwkfa73jdywbdvb3dxb62j4ix3pstmetqqhztekd7y",
    "name": "rclone-lf.txt",
    ...},
  {
    "id": 22,
    "updatedAt": "2022-02-28T10:51:20.004562+08:00",
    "cid": "bafkreifkhy32wd3qowprao4632iqa55nifxmc44mgj4hs7xqxqutirjh4q",
    "name": "Pin.Storage-addContent.png",
    ...},
  {
    "id": 24,
    "updatedAt": "2022-02-28T11:39:26.400316+08:00",
    "cid": "bafybeihxhjivebdivakj336dul5dvijkvzivbd7ornw52bes46ygcbrt7i",
    "name": "Build-on-Filecoin.pptx",
    ...}
]
```

Once Pin.Storage stores your files on IPFS and Filecoin, corresponding CIDs will be generated for each file. You will be able to access those files via IPFS-compatible browsers as well as [IPFS gateways](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/). Use the following command to get the addresses for your files.

```shell
#Get the list of CID
./rclone backend lscid estuaryLocal:ggDrive
 13575031 Feb 28 11:39:26  bafkreifkhy32wd3qowprao4632iqa55nifxmc44mgj4hs7xqxqutirjh4q Pin.Storage-addContent.png

#Get the list of URL for IPFS-compatible browser
./rclone backend lscid estuaryLocal:ggDrive -o format=url
 13575031 Feb 28 11:39:26  ipfs://bafkreifkhy32wd3qowprao4632iqa55nifxmc44mgj4hs7xqxqutirjh4q Pin.Storage-addContent.png

#Get the list of IPFS gateway URL
 ./rclone backend lscid estuaryLocal:ggDrive -o format=gateway
  158798 Feb 28 10:51:20  https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafkreifkhy32wd3qowprao4632iqa55nifxmc44mgj4hs7xqxqutirjh4q Pin.Storage-addContent.png
```

### What's Next?
